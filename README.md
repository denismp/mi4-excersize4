Exercises: Develop and Unit Test Smart Contracts with Truffle We are going to build a contract which allows for funds raising. Mechanics are the same as a single Kickstarter campaign. There is a particular time to reach the goal. If this does not happen, donators are free to request a refund of transferred Ether. If a goal is reached, the owner of the smart contact can withdraw funds. We want to also allow for “anonymous” donation which is merely a transfer of funds to a smart contract. Even if we are saying anonymous, you need to know that all transactions are publicly visible Ether transfer. We are just unable to refund those funds.
